## Summary
- Amazon Prime has more Movies (81%) compared to TV Shows (19%).
- Drama & Comedy are the most common genres.
- Most shows are rated 13+ and 16+, focusing on teens/family-friendly content.
- Huge rise in content production after 2010, peaking in 2021

## Recommendations
- Focus on top genres by creating original content and experimenting with spin-offs or genre mixes.
- Add dubbing and subtitles in popular non-English languages to boost global reach and viewer retention.
- Create themed collections by year (like “90s Classics” or “2010s Hits”) to revive older content and increase engagement.
- Use content ratings data to improve parental controls and personalize profiles (e.g., show more PG/PG-13 content for family users).
- If movies are more popular, turn hit films into limited series. If TV shows dominate, make special event movies to boost weekend viewing.
